# Udacity Cloud DevOps Nanodregree 2020
## Capstone project


### Summary

The idea of this project is to apply all the skills and knoweledge developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program, which include:

* Working in AWS
* Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
* Building pipelines
* Building Docker containers in pipelines
* Working with CloudFormation to deploy clusters
* Building Kubernetes clusters

### The Application

I used a Flask app which consisted of a landing page for an imaginary guitar company called "J&P Guitars". 
The idea of the app is that any user can visit the page and subscribe to the company's newsletter. 
After submitting the  email, the user will receive a welcome email from the company.

### The CI/CD Pipeline
